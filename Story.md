The story revolves around a boy named Eren Yeager, who lives in the town of Shiganshina, located on the edge of Wall Maria, the outermost of three circular walls protecting humanity from Titans. In the year 845, the wall is breached by two new types of Titans, named the Colossal Titan (alternatively named the Colossus) and the Armored Titan. During the incident, Eren's mother is eaten by a Titan while Eren escapes. He swears revenge on all Titans and enlists in the military along with his childhood friends, Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert.

During their first battle, Eren learns that he also has the mysterious ability to turn himself into a sentient Titan, which draws the attention of the nation's military, intending to use his newfound power to reclaim Wall Maria. As the battle against the Titans intensifies, Eren and his companions fight to defend their land while uncovering the mysteries about the Titans, their own civilization, and what lies beyond the walls. Eventually, Eren and those in the military alongside him discover they are not the only humans left alive. They are part of a race, called Eldians, exiled to the walls for crimes against Marleyans, another race. Led by Eren Yeager and his commanding officers, the Eldians begin to wage war against the Marleyans.
